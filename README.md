## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View an age in years, months, and days after submitting a valid date through the form.
- You will receive validation errors if:
  - Any field is empty when the form is submitted
  - The day number is not between 1-31
  - The month number is not between 1-12
  - The year is in the future
  - The date is invalid e.g. 31/04/1991 (there are 30 days in April)
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- **Bonus**: See the age numbers animate to their final number when the form is submitted

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Javascript foundation
- [bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) - For styles


### What I learned

I learn't so many things from writing this project, I can't even list them all here but I will just give some. I learn't you can actually style your project by giving it root class at the begining of you css file and you can assign it any where you need it. I learn't in my html that doing inner styling sometimes will make your work rough, so its better to keep it short and write your style in a seperate file.

I also learnt in java script that you can assign a variable on same line.

```html
<div class="container" style="height:100px">
```
```css
:root{
 --Purple: hsl(259, 100%, 65%);
 --f0nt-size: 40px;
 /* how to use it */
background-color: var(--purple);
}
```
```js
var labelsInput = document.querySelectorAll('.form-group label')
```


### Continued development

But I still want to build my javascript knowlegde, I think I'm still lacking some things so I hope if I'm able to do more frontend-mentor projects which includes me writing javascript code I will improve.
